---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) The purpose of the program

The purpose of the sudoku program is to accept a sudoku solution represented 
as a pgm file. It checks if the file provided abides by the format rules and 
then checkes to see if the solution fulfilles sudoku rules.2D

The purpose of the unblackedges program is to accept a pbm file and clean the 
file such that there are no black edges.

(e) Files provided and their descriptions
unblackedeges.c     : Given a pbm file, this program cleans the bits that 
                      create black edges by making them white. The bits are 
                      stored in a Bit2_T 2D bit vector, and black edge bits 
                      are defined as pixels with value 1 and located at the 
                      edges, or pixels with value 1 and a neighbour that is a 
                      black edge pixel.

sudoku.c            : Given a pgm file that represents a solved sudoku problem 
                      with 9 by 9 dimension and 9 as the max value, this 
                      program checks if the given solution is valid. The 
                      program checks to see if each value in the same row, 
                      same column, or same 3-by-3 subsudoku are unique, and 
                      exits with success if the solution is valid.

uarray2.h           : This file can be used to create a 2D array where a 
                      client can store the data. It also has functions that
                      helps the client to get the width, height, and element 
                      size information about the array, traverse the array in 
                      row major and column major order and access to an element 
                      at a certain location.

uarray2.c           :  This file can be used to create a 2D Uarray where a 
                       client can store data in a 2D array. It also has 
                       functions that helps the client to get the width, 
                       height, and element size information about the array, 
                       traverse the array in row major and column major order,
                       access to an element at a certain location, and free 
                       the UArray.

bit2.h              : This file can be used to create a 2D vector where a 
                      client can store the bit data in. It also has functions 
                      that helps theclient to get the width, height, and 
                      element size information about the vector, traverse the 
                      vector in row major and column major order, and access to
                      an element at a certain location.

bit2.c:             : This file can be used to create a 2D bit vector where a 
                      client can store data in a 2D bit vector. It also has 
                      functions that helps the client to get the width, height,
                      and element size information about the vector, traverse 
                      the vector in row major and column major order, access to
                      an element at a certain location, and free the bit 
                      vector.

pbmReadWrite.h       : This program checks if a given file is in the correct 
                       pbm format. If it is, the program creates a 2D vector 
                       to store the data. The program can also be used to 
                       print out the cleared data in the 2D vector to an 
                       output file.

pbmReadWrite.c       : This program checks if a given file is in the correct 
                       pbm format. If it is, the program creates a 2D Bit2_T 
                       object to store the data. The program can also be used
                       to print out the cleared data in the 2D Bit2_T object 
                       to an output file.

openOrDie.h          : This file is the .h file for openOrDie.c program. It
holds the openOrDie function declaration.

openOrDie.c          : This file contains the function that enables the user
to check if the program is started with the 1 or 2 arguments. It also enables
user to open a file stream from the given arguments or from stdin according
to the number of argument supplied. If the file stream is not opened 
correctly, gives a checked runtime error.
